# Overview

This is a Python Flask application that hosts the deployed weather and time of day prediction models. It also includes two notebooks that show the inital data analysis process used to create the trained models. 

A user may obtain sample images from here to test the models under the folder named sample-imgs/: https://github.com/selh/EnglishBayImageAnalysis

This application is deployed here: https://eng-bay-weather-model.herokuapp.com/
